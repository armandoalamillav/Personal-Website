                <h3 class="subject">Engineering</h3>
                <h6 class="date">2010 - 2015</h6>
                <p>I studied Computer Science Engineering at Tec de Monterrey.
                    <br>
                    I loved engineering, however, I learnt how to cook during my last year
                    at Uni and realized I wanted to become a chef and open a restaurant.
                    I did graduate from CS, but a few months prior to graduating as an engineer I
                    opened a breakfast restaurant in Mexico City.
                    <br>
                    I was deeply involved in the food industry for about six years until 
                    I decided I wanted to get back in the tech industry. I was terribly out of
                    date so my best bet was to look for a Product role.
                </p>
                <h3 class="subject">Product</h3>
                <h6 class="date">2020 - 2024</h6>
                <p >After six years in the restaurant industry, I started looking for a job
                    in tech.  
                    A few months later, I joined <a href="https://parrotsoftware.com.mx/">Parrot</a>. This
                    has been <em>by far</em> the best job I've ever had. I had the most talented and knowledgeable boss
                    as well as a world class engineering team which helped me get a base knowledge of current technology.
                    <br>
                    Right now, I'm a Technical Product Manager at Meal Star, a brand new Food Tech startup.
                </p>
                <h3 class="subject">Now</h3>
                <h6 class="date">Today</h6>
                <p>I've always enjoyed being technical. Really what drives me is understanding 
                    how things work. That's why I'm getting back into coding. This is literally my first project, building my
                    personal website from scratch using HTML and CSS.
                    <br>
                    My goal is, after learning the basics on HTML and CSS, to learn JavaScript and be on my way to become
                    a MERN Full Stack developer. Why MERN? As I said, I've always wanted to be an entrepreneur, and I believe
                    this stack is a great way to create products and prototypes to launch quickly and build a business around it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    By the way, I own a Software Development Company: 
                    <a href="https://livo.com.mx" target="_blank">Livo</a> and a 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@armando.alamilla" id="tribute-link" target="_blank">YouTube Channel</a> 
                    where I share coding tutorials of the concepts I'm learning.</p>
